	abstract = {A survey of bootstrap procedures for constructing confidence regions is given. In particular, several distinct bootstrap methods are considered, with emphasis on the mathematical correctness of these procedures. The percentile, bias-corrected percentile and accelerated bias-corrected percentile methods, developed by Efron, are reviewed in both parametric and nonparametric situations. A procedure related to the accelerated bias-corrected method, which avoids explicit calculation of the analytical corrections required in Efron's method, is also introduced. In the context of a functional approach for the construction of confidence regions, the bootstrap is motivated as a method to estimate the distributions of approximate pivots. Finally, iterative bootstrap methods are discussed as means to improve coverage accuracy.},

The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical signiﬁcance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to TWINSPAN, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies.},

	abstract = {Fish abundance and diversity are core measurements taken by many nearshore marine monitoring projects. The most common approaches for counting ﬁsh include belt transects and timed counts by roving divers, each with its own limitations. Here we evaluate a ﬁsh counting method developed by the Channel Islands National Park’s Kelp Forest Monitoring Program (KFMP), in which roving observers make ﬁsh counts that are standardized both by the time taken (30 min) and the area sampled (2,000 m2). This method is potentially very useful because it combines an advantage of simple timed counts – the ability to rapidly sample a large area – with the potential to calculate area-speciﬁc density of ﬁsh, not just their relative abundance. However, the method has not been comprehensively evaluated and it is uncertain whether ﬁsh can effectively be counted in such a large target area within the allotted time. Fortunately, many sites surveyed with this method are also sampled with a more standard ﬁsh counting approach of belt transects, both by the KFMP and by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans. Here we compare estimates of ﬁsh density obtained through the area-standardized roving diver method and belt transect methods. In paired samples we ﬁnd substantial and species-speciﬁc differences in densities estimated by each method. Considering all ﬁsh taxa together we ﬁnd that roving divers are likely undersampling the target area. Despite considerable species-level variation, the different methods produce similar estimates of average diversity and ﬁnd similar regional and temporal patterns in ﬁsh abundance, demonstrating that they can successfully be used in parallel even if the datasets cannot be easily combined. These analyses can guide the interpretation of roving diver data for basic research and management decisions.},

	abstract = {Net primary production (NPP) is influenced by disturbance-driven fluctuations in foliar standing crop (FSC) and resource-driven fluctuations in rates of recruitment and growth, yet most studies of NPP have focused primarily on factors influencing growth. We quantified NPP, FSC, recruitment, and growth rate for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, at three kelp forests in southern California, USA, over a 54-month period and determined the relative roles of FSC, recruitment, and growth rate in contributing to variation in annual NPP. Net primary production averaged between 0.42 and 2.38 kg dry mass-m\_2-yr\_1 at the three sites. The initial FSC present at the beginning of the growth year and the recruitment of new plants during the year explained 63\% and 21\% of the interannual variation observed in NPP, respectively. The previous year's NPP and disturbance from waves collectively accounted for 80\% of the interannual variation in initial FSC. No correlation was found between annual growth rate (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit of existing kelp mass) and annual NPP (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit area of ocean bottom), largely because annual growth rate was consistent compared to initial FSC and recruitment, which fluctuated greatly among years and sites. Although growth rate was a poor predictor of variation in annual NPP, it was principally responsible for the high mean values observed for NPP by Macrocystis. These high mean values reflected rapid growth (average of ?2\% per day) of a relatively small standing crop (maximum annual mean = 444 g dry mass/m2) that replaced itself approximately seven times per year. Disturbance-driven variability in FSC may be generally important in explaining variation in NPP, yet it is rarely examined because cycles of disturbance and recovery occur over timescales of decades or more in many systems. Considerable insight into how variation in FSC drives variation in NPP may be gained by studying systems such as giant kelp forests that are characterized by frequent disturbance and rapid rates of growth and recruitment.

Besides characterizing the ecological preference of the species, the strength of the association usually presents a lot of interest for conservation biology, landscape mapping and management, and natural reserve design, among other applications. The indices most frequently employed to assess these relationships are the phi coefﬁcient of association and the indicator value index (IndVal). We compare these two approaches by putting them into a broader framework of related measures, which includes several new indices. We present permutation tests to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of species–site group associations and bootstrap methods for obtaining conﬁdence intervals. Correlation measures, such as the phi coefﬁcient, are more context-dependent than indicator values but allow focusing on the preference of the species. In contrast, the two components of an indicator value index directly assess the value of the species as a bioindicator because they can be interpreted as its positive predictive value and sensitivity. Ecologists should select the most appropriate index of association strength according to their objective and then compute conﬁdence intervals to determine the precision of the estimate.},

	abstract = {Management of sustainable fisheries depends upon reliable estimates of stock assessment. Assessment of many stocks is based entirely on fishery-dependent data (e.g., catch per unit effort), which can be problematic. Here we use fishery-independent data on stock size, collected within and outside of no-take reserves before and after the onset of fishing, to evaluate the status of the dive fishery for warty sea cucumbers, Parastichopus parvimensis, in southern California. Long-term monitoring data showed that abundance decreased throughout the Channel Islands within 3–6 years after the onset of fishing. No significant changes in the abundance of P. parvimensis were observed at the two non-fished reserve sites, although densities tended to increase following onset of the fishery. Before–after, control–impact (BACI) analyses of seven fished and two non-fished sites implicated fishing mortality as the cause of 33–83\% stock declines. In sharp contrast, stock assessment based on CPUE data showed no declines and a significant increase at one island. To date, most discussion on marine reserves has focused on the protection and enhancement of exploited populations. Our study demonstrates the critically important, but often overlooked, role that marine reserves can play in providing reliable information on stock assessment.},

	abstract = {Based on the variability of heat content in the upper 300 m of the ocean (HC300), the feasibility of deﬁning an index of Paciﬁc decadal oscillation (PDO) is explored. The motivation for deﬁning the PDO index on HC300 stems from the following considerations: (i) a need to accentuate lower-frequency variations in the monitoring of PDO and (ii) to take into account variations in the temperatures associated with the PDO that extend throughout the upper ocean (and are modulated by the seasonal cycle of mixed layer variability). It is demonstrated that an HC300-based deﬁnition is better suited to encapsulate these characteristics in the PDO variability. The variability in an HC300-based deﬁnition is also contrasted with the traditional deﬁnition of the PDO based on SSTs.},

	abstract = {We use data from San Miguel Island shell middens spanning much of the past 10,000 years in a preliminary exploration of long-term ecological relationships between humans, sea otters (Enhydra lutris), shellfish, and kelp forests. At Daisy Cave, human use of marine habitats begins almost 11,500 years ago, with the earliest evidence for shellfish harvesting (11,500 cal BP), intensive kelp bed fishing (ca. 10,000–8,500 cal BP), and sea otter hunting (ca. 8,900 cal BP) from the Pacific Coast of North America. On San Miguel Island, Native Americans appear to have coexisted with sea otters and productive shellfish populations for over 9,000 years, but the emphasis of shellfish harvesting changed over time. Knowledge of modern sea otter behavior and ecology suggests that shell middens dominated by large red abalone shells (Haliotis rufescens)—relatively common on San Miguel between about 7,300 and 3,300 years ago—are only likely to have formed in areas where sea otter populations had been reduced by Native hunting or other causes. Preliminary analysis of lenses, in which the remains of urchins are unusually abundant, may also signal an increasing impact of Island Chumash populations on kelp forest and other near shore habitats during the late Holocene. Such impacts were probably relatively limited, however, when compared to the rapid and severe disruption caused by commercial exploitation under the Spanish, Mexican, and American regimes of historic times.},
